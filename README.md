Imaging Spectroscopy Tutorial Materials

This is a sequence of hands-on lab experiences using open source code for imaging spectrometer data analysis.  They introduce the basic concepts behind these instruments, and provide practical experience in visualization, atmospheric correction, and surface property estimation with rigorous uncertainty propagation. 

Course exercises are conducted and submitted as notebook documents. They also rely on the open-source ISOFIT codebase for atmospheric correction. We suggest the OpenSPEC project for visualization capability similar to that provided in the ENVI interface.  Consider first getting these dependencies from:
-	A clone of the ISOFIT repository, https://github.com/isofit/isofit
-	A clone of the OpenSpectra project, https://github.com/openspectra/openspectra

An easy cross-platform way to get all the necessary Python dependencies (and juypter notebook capability) is to download the anaconda distribution, available at https://www.anaconda.com

Finally, there are a few large binary files that you will need for certain exercises, and are not stored in the repository due to their size.  These are currently posted to ftp://popo.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/DThompson/istutor/ but the location may change in the future.
