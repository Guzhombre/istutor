Warning from routine RM_SSS:  For segment no.    6 of line-of-sight no.    1,  the single scatter solar radiance (  2.161494E-09 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1)
                              was found to exceed the DISORT segment single plus multiple scatter solar radiance (  2.142472E-09 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1)!
                              This tends to occur at high altitudes, where scattering contributions are small.  The
                              solar multiple scatter radiance for this segment is being set to zero.  This warning will
                              only be repeated if the problem occurs for a larger segment single scatter solar radiance.
