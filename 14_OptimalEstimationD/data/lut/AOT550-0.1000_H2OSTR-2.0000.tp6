Warning from routine RM_SSS:  For segment no.    6 of line-of-sight no.    1,  the single scatter solar radiance (  1.672114E-09 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1)
                              was found to exceed the DISORT segment single plus multiple scatter solar radiance (  1.662407E-09 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1)!
                              This tends to occur at high altitudes, where scattering contributions are small.  The
